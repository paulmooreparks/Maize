# The Maize Virtual Machine

This project implements a 64-bit virtual machine called "Maize." This is an outgrowth of my [Tortilla](https://github.com/paulmooreparks/Tortilla) 
project, which began life as an x86 emulator implemented in C# on .NET and then later became a virtual CPU of my own making.

The near-term goal for the Maize project is to implement a set of devices to bridge from the virtual environment to the host machine, 
create a "BIOS" layer above the virtual devices, and implement a simple OS and a subset of Unix/Linux system calls (interrupt $80), 

## What It Is, Basically

* A 64-bit virtual machine implemented in C++ that executes a custom byte code
* An assembly language that represents the byte code
* An assembler implemented in C++ that generates byte code from the assembly language
* A very simple BIOS and OS that bridges the VM and the underlying machine
* An execution environment implemented in C++ that so far runs on Windows and Linux and could easily be ported to other platforms

## Yeah, but... WHY?

It's a long story.

In 2016 I had a contract working on an ARM system, and I wasn't too familiar with ARM assembly. I had an idea to write an ARM 
emulator, since I've always believed that the best way to understand a system is to try to build one. After getting stuck with the 
ARM emulator, I decided to first build an x86 emulator and then go back to ARM. While I knew x86 assembly well enough to debug it, 
I wasn't really an expert at it, and I didn't know the lowest levels of machine language. I thought that tackling an ISA I knew 
would help me get the basics sorted out, and I'd come back to ARM later.

I got the x86 emulator working well enough to run code generated by standard compilers, but by then I wasn't working on ARM anymore, and I 
was more interested in learning about how CPUs work. I also found 
[Ben Eater's Youtube! channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater/playlists), where he builds an 8-bit computer from scratch, and I decided 
to use those as guidance for building a virtual CPU of my own design. The first implementation of that was the 
[Tortilla](https://github.com/paulmooreparks/Tortilla) project.

With Tortilla, I wrote code for every single cycle of each instruction, as if the CPU were moving data around the buses like a physical CPU. That 
was fun and enlightening, but it was also terribly inefficient. I decided to rewrite the entire thing in C++ and make the virtual machine more of a 
byte-code execution environment rather than a simulation of a CPU, and that became the Maize project. The idea is to be able to compile any language 
to Maize byte code and run it on any system that can run the Maize VM.

No, I never got back around to the ARM emulator, and at this point I doubt I will.

## Uses for Maize

Honestly, it's mainly a toy to learn about a few concepts:

* How byte-code virtual machines work
* The construction of an assembly language and corresponding assemblers and disassemblers
* Porting compiler back-ends to a new architecture
* Learning how to write an OS and BIOS for a new architecture
* Learning how systems integrate with hardware.

It's been really useful for all of the above, but what I'm most excited about is the promise of compiling any language to Maize byte code and running 
it anywhere that can run the Maize VM. 

## How To Use Maize

Maize is implemented in standard C++ and will run on Windows and Linux. The primary executable is 
[maize](https://github.com/paulmooreparks/Maize/blob/master/src/maize.cpp), which accepts a path to a binary file to execute. You may generate a 
binary from Maize assembly with the [mazm](https://github.com/paulmooreparks/Maize/blob/master/src/mazm.cpp) executable, which accepts a path to 
an assembly file and outputs a BIN file that can then be executed with maize.

I haven't finished porting all of the instructions from the .NET implementation yet, but now that I've finished restructuring the 
code it shouldn't take too long to complete them.

The [assembler](https://github.com/paulmooreparks/Maize/blob/master/src/mazm.cpp) is still VERY bare-bones, but it's enough to generate 
usable executables.

## Project Status

As I said in the original [.NET implementation](https://github.com/paulmooreparks/Tortilla/), it's very early days for Maize, so don't 
expect too much in the way of application usability... yet! I'm still porting the basic text-mode console for input and output. 
Next, I'll start creating a file-system device. I am currently porting [QBE](https://c9x.me/compile/) to output Maize assembly so that I can 
write Maize binaries with standard C and eventually port Linux to the virtual CPU.

In the short term, I'm implementing a very basic OS over a simple BIOS ([core.asm](https://github.com/paulmooreparks/Maize/blob/master/asm/core.asm)). 
It will provide a basic character-mode [CLI](https://github.com/paulmooreparks/Maize/blob/master/asm/cli.asm) to allow building and running simple 
Maize programs from within the virtual CPU environment. 

So far, this implementation in C++ is MUCH faster and MUCH tighter than the .NET version.

The near-term road map is as follows:

* Finish implementing all of the instructions documented below (in progress)
* Add a Maize back end to [CProc](https://sr.ht/~mcf/cproc/) and build Maize BIOS & OS in standard C (in progress)
* Implement a linker so that binaries can be built independently and linked together
* Introduce "devices," which were partially implemented in the .NET version
* Clean up the assembler (mazm) and introduce some proper error checking
* Make the assembler read Unicode source files
* Implement floating-point arithmetic
* Add a Maize backend to GCC and port GNU tools to Maize.

## Instruction Description 

Numeric values are represented in Maize assembly and Maize documentation in binary, decimal, or
hexadecimal formats. The % character precedes binary-encoded values, the # character precedes
decimal-encoded values, and the $ character precedes hexadecimal-encoded values.

    %00000001   binary value
    #123        decimal value
    $FFFE1000   hexadecimal value

The underscore, back-tick (`) and comma (,) characters may all be used as numeric separators in
all encodings.

Examples:

    %0000`0001
    %1001_1100
    #123,456,789
    $0000_FFFF
    $FE,DC,BA,98
    $1234`5678
    #123,456_789`021

Instructions are variable-length encoded and may have zero, one, or two parameters. An instruction
opcode is encoded as a single eight-bit byte defining the opcode and instruction flags, and each
instruction parameter is defined in an additional byte per parameter. Immediate values are encoded
following the opcode and parameter bytes in little-endian format (least-significant bytes are
stored lower in memory).

When an instruction has two parameters, the first parameter is the source parameter, and the second
parameter is the destination parameter.

Example: Load the value $01 into register A.

    LD $01 A

Example: Encoding of "LD $FFCC4411 D", which loads the immediate value $FFCC4411 into register D.
$41 is the opcode and flags for the instruction which loads an immediate value into a register.
$02 is the parameter byte specifying a four-byte immediate value as the source parameter. $3E is
the parameter byte specifying the 64-bit register D as the destination parameter. The bytes
following the parameters bytes are the immediate value in little-endian format.

    $41 $02 $3E $11 $44 $CC $FF

Immediate values may used as pointers into memory. This is represented in assembly by the '@'
prefix in front of the immediate value.

Example: Load the 64-bit value at address $0000`1000 into register B.

    LD @$0000`1000 B

Register values may be used as pointers into memory by adding a '@' prefix in front of the
register name.

Example: Store the value $FF into the byte pointed at by the A.H0 register:

    ST $FF @A.H0

Example: Load the quarter-word located at the address stored in D.H0 into sub-register Z.Q3:

    LD @D.H0 Z.Q3


## Registers

Registers are 64-bits wide (a "word") and are each divided into smaller sub-registers.

    A  General purpose
    B  General purpose
    C  General purpose
    D  General purpose
    E  General purpose
    G  General purpose
    H  General purpose
    J  General purpose
    K  General purpose
    L  General purpose
    M  General purpose
    Z  General purpose
    
    F  Flag register
    IN Instruction register
    P  Program execution register
    S  Stack register


### Sub-registers

Sub-registers are defined as half-word (H), quarter-word (Q), and byte (B) widths. The full
64-bit value of a register (for example, register A) may be coded as "A" or "A.W0". The register
value may also be accessed as separate half-word (32-bit) values, coded as A.H1 (upper 32 bits)
and A.H0 (lower 32-bits). The 16-bit quarter-words are similarly coded as A.Q3, A.Q2, A.Q1, and
A.Q0. Finally, the individual byte values are coded as A.B7, A.B6, A.B5, A.B4, A.B3, A.B2, A.B1,
and A.B0.

Shown graphically, the 64-bit value $FEDCBA9876543210 would be stored as follows:

     FE  DC  BA  98  76  54  32  10
    [B7][B6][B5][B4][B3][B2][B2][B0]
    [Q3    ][Q2    ][Q1    ][Q0    ]
    [H1            ][H0            ]
    [W0                            ]

In other words, if the following instruction were executed:

    LD $FEDCBA9876543210 A

The value stored in register A could then be represented as follows:

    A    = $FEDCBA9876543210
    A.W0 = $FEDCBA9876543210
    A.H1 = $FEDCBA98
    A.H0 = $76543210
    A.Q3 = $FEDC
    A.Q2 = $BA98
    A.Q1 = $7654
    A.Q0 = $3210
    A.B7 = $FE
    A.B6 = $DC
    A.B5 = $BA
    A.B4 = $98
    A.B3 = $76
    A.B2 = $54
    A.B1 = $32
    A.B0 = $10


### Special-purpose Registers

There are four special-purpose registers.

    F  Flags register. FL is an alias for F.H0, which contains a bit field of individual flags. 
       Flags in F.H1 may only be set in privileged mode.
 
    IN Instruction register, set by the instruction decoder as instructions and parameters are
       read from memory. This register can only be set by the decoder.
 
    P  Program execution register, which is the pointer to the next instruction to be decoded
       and executed. This is further sub-divided into P.H1, which is the current code segment,
       and P.H0, which is the effective program counter within the current segment. P.H1 may
       only be written to in privileged mode. PC is an alias for P.H0.
 
    S  Stack register, which is the location within the current segment at which the stack
       starts (growing downward in memory). This is further sub-divided into S.H1, which is
       the base pointer, and S.H0, which is the current stack pointer. SP is an alias for S.H0, 
       and BP is an alias for S.H1.

### Flags

(more coming on this)

## Execution

The CPU starts in privileged mode, and the program counter is initially set to segment $00000000,
address $00000000. When in privileged mode, the privilege flag is set, and instructions marked
as privileged may be executed. When the privilege flag is cleared, instruction execution and
memory access are limited to the current segment, and certain flags, registers, and instructions
are inaccessible. Program execution may return to privileged mode via hardware interrupts or via
software-generated (INT instruction) interrupts.


## Opcode Bytes

Opcodes are defined in an 8-bit byte separated into two flag bits and six opcode bits.

    %BBxx`xxxx  Flags bit field (bits 6 and 7)
    %xxBB`BBBB  Opcode bit field (bits 0 through 5)

When an instruction has a source parameter that may be either a register or an immediate value,
then bit 6 is interpreted as follows:

    %x0xx`xxxx  source parameter is a register
    %x1xx`xxxx  source parameter is an immediate value

When an instruction's source parameter may be either a value or a pointer to a value, then
bit 7 is interpreted as follows:

    %0xxx`xxxx  source parameter is a value
    %1xxx`xxxx  source parameter is a memory address

When bit 5 is set (%xx1x`xxxx), all eight bits are used to define the numeric opcode value.

## BIOS Interface

BIOS calls will track as closely as possible to the "standard" BIOS routines found on typical
x86 PCs. The x86 registers used in BIOS calls will map to Maize registers as follows:

    AX -> A.Q0
       AL -> A.B0
       AH -> A.B1
    BX -> A.Q1
       BL -> A.B2
       BH -> A.B3
    CX -> A.Q2
       CL -> A.B4
       CH -> A.B5
    DX -> A.Q3
       DL -> A.B6
       DH -> A.B7


## OS ABI

The first six arguments to OS-level routines will be placed, from left to right, into the
G, H, J, K, L, and M registers. Any remaining arguments will be pushed onto the stack.
For example:

    ; Call C function "void random_os_function(int32_t a, const char *b, size_t c, int32_t* d)"
    LD $0000`1234 G         ; int32_t a
    LD A.H0 H               ; const char* b, assuming the pointer is in A.H0
    LD $0000`00FF J         ; size_t c
    LD B.H1 K               ; int32_t* d, assuming the pointer is in B.H1
    CALL random_os_function

The called routine will preserve B, C, D, E, Z, and SP. Any other registers may not be
preserved. Return values will placed into the A register. For example:

    ; Implement C function "int add(int a, int b)"
    LD G A
    ADD H A
    RET

For syscalls, the same standard will be followed for syscall parameters. The syscall number
will be placed into the A register prior to calling the interrupt.

    ; Output a string using sys_write
    LD $01 A             ; syscall 1 = sys_write
    LD $01 G             ; file descriptor 1 (STDOUT) in register G
    LD hello_world H.H0  ; string address in register H
    LD hello_world_end J
    SUB hello_world J    ; string length in register J
    INT $80              ; call sys_write

The same syscall may be made with the SYS instruction, which will execute the syscall directly.

    ; Output a string using sys_write, calling directly via SYS instruction
    LD $01 G             ; file descriptor 1 (STDOUT) in register G
    LD hello_world H.H0  ; string address in register H
    LD hello_world_end J
    SUB hello_world J    ; string length in register J
    SYS $01              ; call sys_write


## Assembler Syntax

(This section is incomplete and a bit of a work in progress. Refer to HelloWorld.asm,
stdlib.asm, and core.asm for practical examples.)

Tokens with leading double-underscore (e.g., __foo) are reserved.

    %00000001   binary
    #123        decimal
    $FFFE1000   hexadecimal

Other syntax, to be described more fully later:

    LABEL labelName labelData | AUTO

    DATA dataValue [dataValue] [dataValue] [...]

    STRING "stringvalue"

    ADDRESS address | labelName
